# Home-Automation-Project
This project implements a smart home automation system using Arduino Uno and various sensors, including DHT (humidity and temperature), PIR (motion), LDR (light), and IR sensors. The system automates the control of household appliances such as a fan and LED lamp based on environmental conditions and motion detection within the home.
